I am basically a hardware guy and would like to use my spare time to learn something I am interested in.
Recently, I am focused in AI-related stuffs like machine learning (ML) and reinforcement learning (RL).
Would like to use the GitHub and this blog to share the code I am working and my thinking about ML and RL.
Feel free to let me know any input, feedback, comment you have :)
